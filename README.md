This project was developed to showcase the new features of ECMAScript6.  

It uses fetch() and arrow functions to access an API to pull into images of dogs. 

It was written with codenvy, a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment.  

I integrated it with GitHub and set-up Heroku to continously deploy it by making heroku think it was an php app.

It also uses some HTML5 and Bootstrap. 

Thanks for checking it out, and to the Dog CEO for providing the API (https://dog.ceo/)
